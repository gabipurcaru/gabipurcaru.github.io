Hello! I assume you're here because you thought you might
find something interesting, and who am I to disappoint?


Here's a fun little question for you:

======|=>==========================================
120    ^ you                                      0

You're driving a car on a highway that is 120 miles long, starting
from mile #120 going towards mile #0. You adjust your speed such
that when you are at mile X, you're driving X miles/hour, e.g. at
mile #87.12556 you're driving 87.12556 miles/hour.

Where are you after 1 hour?


If you email me the solution, I'd be glad to have a talk with you over
some beverage of your choice.
